# QT-Cpp-NumberSaver

* A project which i developed when i was serving my country(Hellenic Army).
* The project aims to save, display and handle a variaty of infos from military files, using a .TXT file as "database" for security reasons.
* Project designed, developed and deployed on army's computers without internet connection(security reasons also). 
* The Layout.jpg file can give you a taste, of course u can try the x64 "deployed" .exe.
